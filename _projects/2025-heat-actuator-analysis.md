**A qualitative description of the device or system**
The device we chose to look at was a heat exchanger. It has four ports, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, where 1 flows to 2 (and vice versa) and 3 flows to 4 (and vice versa). There is one cold water reservoir, consisting of a bucket with ice water placed inside styrofoam insulation, and one hot water reservoir, consisting of a bucket with water and an attached immersion heater.
